# Leaderboard

The leaderboard website displays scores submitted by different players. It also allows you to submit your score. All data is preserved thanks to the external Leaderboard API service.

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- WebPack and Gitflow.

## Getting Started

For this application the priority is to create a working version of the leaderboard that preserves user input. I build a website according to the wireframe. Then, I connect to the Leaderboard API (as described in its documentation) in order to implement the actions behind the "Refresh" and "Submit" buttons. In the last step, I play with async & await and add as much styling as possible in the given time.
